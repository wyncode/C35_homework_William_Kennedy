Write a program that **outputs** the numbers 1 to 100, however:

1) If the number is a multiple of 3 log `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
2) If the number is a multiple of 5 log `"Buzz"` instead of the number.
3) For the numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 log `"FizzBuzz"` instead of the number.

Remember, break the problem up in to manageable chunks. Upon reading, you should see "Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100" and stop, because you already have enough information to write code and make that happen. Once your loop is up and running, continue reading until you reach another point where you have enough information to write some code. Continue this process until you've solved the entire problem. You can do it!

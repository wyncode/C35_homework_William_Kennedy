Here we start getting options. Using either a **function** or a **loop** (or both if you feel brave enough) let's grab this _Array_:

```js
let actors = ['Michael Fox', 'Christopher Lloyd', 'Lea Thompson', 'Claudia Wells'];
```
Since we can't decide which Back to the Future actor we like best, we are going to praise them all.
Write a loop that will **output**:

```js
Michael Fox is so cool.
Christopher Lloyd is so cool.
Lea Thompson is so cool.
Claudia Wells is so cool.
```

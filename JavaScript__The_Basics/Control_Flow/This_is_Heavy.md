Up next: control flow!

Implement this in JavaScript:

1. Create a variable called `hoverboards` and set its value to `0`.
2. Create control flow logic for the following:

- if the `hoverboards` is greater than OR equal to `100` - then log `"The future rocks!"`

- if `hoverboards` is less than `100` AND `hoverboards` is greater than `1` - then log `"The future is pretty cool."` 

- if `hoverboards` is exactly equal to `1` - then log `"Meh."`

- otherwise log `"The future is boring."`

Important to note: Make sure that your output looks **EXACTLY** as in the instructions.

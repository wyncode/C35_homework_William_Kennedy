Variables allow us to abstract the value of things and focus on the result. Given the following variables: 

```js 
let firstName = "Sam"; 
let timeOfDay = "morning"; 
``` 
Generate this **output** in the console: 
`Good morning Sam!` 

You are going to do this **two** times: 
1. Using _concatenation with regular "quotes"_ 
2. Using _template literals_ (interpolation)

Please submit the given code for evaluation.

**Start with** this string...

```js
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
```

  ...and output this string...

```js
"abcdeeefghhijklmnoooopqrrsttuuvwxyz"
```

Notice that the end string contains all the characters in the first one.
You're going to have to do some research to find the methods you can chain together to get this result. When searching online, check the JS documentation before jumping over to StackOverflow.
Also, take into consideration that `String`s may not be able to do _everything_ that you need to do so you may have to play with another **data type** to achieve your result.
Using `replace()` is not allowed - that would be too easy. We expect you to use multiple methods in succession to get the correct answer.

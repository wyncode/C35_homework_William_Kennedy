Welcome to learning your first language! The first step in learning any new language is picking up the syntax. As far as programming languages go, JavaScript is not a complex language.

Letâ€™s begin with something simple.
- _First_:  declare two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`.
- _Then_: assign your first and last name to the corresponding variable.
- _Last_: go ahead and use the standard Javascript output to **print** the values of both variables one at a time.

Your task is to use the `curl` command to download the file located here: http://bit.ly/2nmGpwm and save it to a file called `car.txt`

Steps:

1. Google the right way to handle an HTTP redirect with `curl`. (There is no need to worry about trying to understand what an HTTP redirect is just yet)

2. Find out how to redirect the output from curl to a file named `car.txt`

3. Provide the command you used to download the file and save it to your computer


Check your work before submitting a response by copying and pasting the following command in the terminal *after* you have run your code. 


```bash

Input: bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.ly/2Ln4eOr)

# The current working directory must be the same as the one when you typed the commands.

Output: # Varies according to the test.


```

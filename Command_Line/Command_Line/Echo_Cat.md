```

Check your work by copying, pasting, and running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
Input: bash <(curl -sL http://bit.ly/2L4n2S7)

Output: # This will vary.

Explanation: A script is run that checks the code.
```

Then run this command:

```sh
Input: cat hello_world.txt

Output: # Observe in your terminal.

```

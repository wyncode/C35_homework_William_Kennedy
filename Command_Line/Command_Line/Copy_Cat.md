Submit 2 lines of code in Markdown format with the language name of bash.

Your submission should look something like the following:

Each bullet point coresponds to a single line of code in the terminal.

The 2 lines of code must accomplish the following:

* Use `echo` to create a **new** file in the current working directory named `hello_world.txt` containing the string `Hello, world.`


```bash

Input: # Type your command.

Output: # Nothing will be output to the screen.


```

* Use `cat` to output the contents of the file `hello_world.txt` in the current working directory. 

In the same line of code the output of `cat` should be redirected into a **new** file named `hello_copy.txt` using a character for redirection of output. 

This character is known as a "redirection operator".

```bash

Input: # Type your command.

Output: # Nothing will be output to the screen.


```

Optionally check your work by copying and pasting the following command in the terminal *after* you have run both lines of code. 


```bash

Input: bash <(curl -Ls http://bit.ly/2Jebn6j)

# The current working directory must be the same as the one when you typed the commands.

Output: # Varies according to the test.


```

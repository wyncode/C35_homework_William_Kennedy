Here is some HTML - can you please update it so it uses appropriate classes & id's that make it easy to style? 

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <h1>Bill Murray</h1>
    <img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/200" alt="bill murray" />
    <a href="/users/1">View Bill's profile</a>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h1>Nick Cage</h1>
    <img src="http://www.placecage.com/200/200" alt="nick cage" />
    <a href="/users/1">View Nick's profile</a>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h1>Stevey Segal</h1>
    <img src="https://www.stevensegallery.com/200/200" alt="steven segal" />
    <a href="/users/3">View Stevey's profile</a>
  </div>
</div>
``` 

Keep in mind, we're trying to add meaningful information to the HTML as to what it contains so we can style it appropriately. For instance, we want every link to be a button, so we'd add a `class` of button to the `a` tags here.

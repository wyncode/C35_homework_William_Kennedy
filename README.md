## Goodmeasure substitute.

Until Goodmeasure is functional again, let's use GitHub to do the homework.

Each student should have their own repository with push and pull access.

The file structure is as follows:

Clone this repository to your computer.

For each homework task do the following:
    
* Create an issue.
* Create a branch with the issue number and task name as the branch name.
* Edit the Markdown formatted task file by putting your answer at the bottom of the file.
  **All code should be Markdown escaped.**
* `git add`
* `git commit -m <your message here>`
* `git push origin <your branch name for the task>`
